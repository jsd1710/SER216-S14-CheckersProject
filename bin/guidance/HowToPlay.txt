Setup:
The board is already setup per checker regulations.
Regular pieces are yellow or red.
King pieces will be noted by having a star on them.

Turns:
Players will take turns moving pieces.

Moving:
Moves are allowed only on the dark squares, so pieces always move diagonally. 
Regular pieces are always limited to forward moves (toward the opponent).
King pieces must still move diagonally, but they may move forwards or backwards.
A piece making a non-capturing move (not involving a jump) may move only one square.

Capturing:
A piece making a capturing move (a jump) leaps over one of the opponent's pieces, landing in a straight diagonal line on the other side. 
Only one piece may be captured in a single jump; however, multiple jumps are allowed on a single turn.
When a piece is captured, it is removed from the board.
If you can capture a piece legally, then you must capture that piece; 
If there are multiple pieces you can capture, you may choose which one to capture.

King:
When a piece reaches the farthest row from the player who controls that piece, it becomes a king. 

Winning:
A player wins when their opponent cannot make any moves.
This can be done by either capturing all opponents pieces, or blocking all opponents pieces from making legal moves.
